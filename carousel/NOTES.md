# Carousel

A simple carousel that allows for switching between multiple iframes via arrows on the side, including a "preloading" feature that will load all of the iframes at once for faster transitions.

## Example
An example can be found at https://carousel-example.glitch.me/. I use "https://example.com" and "https://example.org".
